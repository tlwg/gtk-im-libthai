  * New upstream release.
    - Better support for text input when surrounding text is mixed with other 
      language
    - Clean up configure and build system
    - Fix compiler warnings
  * Bumped standard version to 3.7.2, no changes needed.
  * Added watch file.
  * Reverted build-dependency on libgtk2.0-bin introduced in NMU, as it's now
    unneeded by new upstream. (Actually closes: #384360)
  * Added dependency on libgtk2.0-bin, and used update-gtk-immodules instead
    of directly calling gtk-query-immodules-2.0 in postinst and postrm.
  * Replaced hard-coded depends with ${shlibs:Depends} and ${misc:Depends}.
  * Fixed debian/dirs so it creates correct dir.
  * Do not install *.la files.
  * Removed unused dh_installexamples and dh_installman from debien/rules.
  * Added back config.sub and config.guess replacements.
